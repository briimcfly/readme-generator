## Reflection 
This project has allowed me to apply the core skills I have recently learned and put them into practice. During development, I had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of the npm. Additionally, I developed a deeper appreciation for for the importance code commenting, and the development principal DRY. (Don't repeat yourself). In the future, I would like to spend more time giving users more control in the type of information they want to add to the readme. i.e. code blocks, lists, etc.
